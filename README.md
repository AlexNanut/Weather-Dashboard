# Overview

A weather dashboard that will present the user with today's current weather data and then a future five day forecast. It will also store the past search results allowing the user to select them and see that cities weather data again.  

To use the dashboard, type the name of a city in the search box and click on the search button. As you search, the city will be saved to a list allowing you to select them again for viewing.

# Essential Criteria 

I have applied the essential criteria as follows:

* When I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history
* When I view current weather consitions for that city, then I am presented with the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that display the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* When I click on a city in the search history
* Then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
